                                Day 6 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Six Pack Abs! Yogi style. This is a shorter practice to tone the abdominals in a mindful way that feels fun and supportive! Also, almost everyone wants more core strength and tone abdominals. You asked for it!

                                Use this Day 6 practice to check in with the core. Mindful core training will support your entire practice and whole body health. While tone abs are something we all fancy (me too) core strength training is so much more than washboard abs or a flat tummy. By building core strength you are supporting the the back and all of the muscles that surround your dear spinal cord. By working those muscles we are taking some of our weight off the spine and engaging the entire body. We are more likely to do active, engaging things when the body is strong & engaged. Great for runners, dancers, movers and shakers! Great for grounding the spirit.                        </div>

                                Day 8 invites you slow down, cultivate balance and CONNECT. We open the hips in this sequence and use the subtle power of the breath to find release and let go. Connect to your spirit, soften, stretch and relax. If you are used to moving fast this may be a challenge for you. Enjoy the rejuvenating and restorative benefits of yoga and meditation. This should feel AWESOME after the first week of the 30 Day Of Yoga Journey. Relax and enjoy! You deserve it.                            </p>

                                Day 23 is not the power yoga you are used to. Rather, this sequence invites us to find power and strength through acceptance, forgiveness and letting go. Day 23 is an awesome journey! Modify as needed and find what really feels good. This practice will give you a good workout, stretch, strengthen and soothe. But beyond that, this breath focused playtime is the perfect sequence to practice letting go. Let go to create space for empowerment and new found strength. Let the practice be a mirror. Don't be hard on yourself. Be yourself. Be kind. Find freedom within the form and strength in letting go. Practice forgiveness as a way to keep moving forward.

                                Join Adriene on Day 24 of the 30 Days of Yoga journey! Gentle Yummy Yoga to restore. Quick and supportive practice! *With extended Savasana!* Find balance in your 30 Day Yoga Journey. If you are thinking about skipping this one - don't! This restorative Happy Hips practice has your back.
                                On Day 24 we take it easy on the upper body and restore. This yummy sequence increases mobility with a variety of stretches for the legs and hips. "Allow, release, let go"
                                
                                I figured we could all use this today. Gentle Yoga is not just "easy yoga" - for me it is essential in finding balance and ease.

                                Day 26 of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! Earth Practice. Say whaaa? In this practice we use the earth to connect, ground, stretch and lift from. We learn another pranayama or breath technique and of course, have a little fun with a full body practice.

                                This 20 min yoga sequence has it all! It invites you to go deeper. Re-connect to home, ease and mother earth. Yeah, I said it. Simple meditation pose is there for you. This yoga sequence also invites you get low and be human. Explore all lines of movement with the support of the earth. We will stretch, open, and remove stress that has manifested in the body. We will tend to the feet and trek into the unknown! We will connect to our core - and keep returning back to the breath - reconnecting to YOU.

                                Day 30 of of The 30 Days of Yoga journey! You made it. We rolled out the mat for 30 Days. It may have taken longer than 30 Days - but you did it. You are here, now.

How lucky are we to have this practice to grow and this experience to learn from?! Who would have thought you could appreciate the tools of yoga at home in such a way and be your own boss?
